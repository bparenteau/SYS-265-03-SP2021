Prereqs for the lab: Make sure you've seet up your AWS student account via the email sent and that you have a linux machine capable of sshing in (I used a kali linux VM)

I) Redhat Instance
  In the AWS console, click "Launch a Virtual Machine"
  Navigate down the list until you find the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (HVM) that is listed as being free
    Make sure 64 bit x86 is selected and hit the blue button
  All of the default configurations for the VM can be kept as defaults, so you can navigate through them or just select the Review and Launch button
  Next, click Launch
  When prompted for a key pair, choose to create a new one and name it SYS265-SP21, and MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT
    Download the file and move it to your desktop so it is easier to call upon later. It may be a good idea to back up the file for easier access
  Launch the instance.
  Navigate to the "Instances" page, click on the blue name of the VM (it's a good idea to name it, click on the -- before the name to do so) and note the PUBLIC IP address
  Open a command prompt on your linux machine (MAKE SURE THE KEY FILE IS ON THAT MACHINE)
  Change the permissions of the key with "chmod 600 Desktop/SYS265-SP21.pem" to ensure there are no issues with it when sshing
  Now, ssh into the Redhat instance with "ssh ec2-user@[ip address from the Instances page] -i Desktop/SYS265-SP21.pem"
  You will now be in the Redhat instance
  
  To update the instance:
    sudo yum -y update
  
  To install python on the instance:
    sudo yum -y install python3.8
  
  Starting a python http server:
    Create a new directory on the redhat instance with "mkdir test-firewall"
    Change the directory with "cd test-firewall"
    Create a sample html page with "echo "Testing EC2 Firewall" > index.html"
    Use python to start the server on port 9000 with "python3.8 -m http.server 9000"
    Back on AWS, go to the instance for Redhat, navigate to the Security tab, and open security groups
    Edit the inbound rules to add a new rules with Custom TCP as the protocol, 9000 as the port, a source of 0.0.0.0/0, and a description of testing firewall.
    Save rules.
    Then naviagte to the webpage using either the IP address for the Redhat instance or the DNS option given, followed with :9000, and your html page should show.

II) Windows 2019 Server
  Navigate back to the page for creating an instance (you can use the orange Launch instance button in the top right corner of the instances page as well)
  Navigate through the page unti you find the "Microsoft Windows Server 2019" listed as being free, go through the setup pages until you get to the security groups page and
    select "use an existing", choosing launch-wizard 1, then review and launch the VM. (Make sure you choose to use the same key as before)
  Once again navigate to the security groups configuration page, and add an inbound rule for RDP using port 3389, sourced from 0.0.0.0/0 and with a description of RDP Inbound
  To get the admin password for the machine, go to the instances page, select the windows machine (which, once again, you should rename), select Actions, Security, then
    Get Windows Password
  Upload the key file when prompted, hit decrypt password, and take note of this password somehow.
  Now, on a windows machine, use mstsc to remote into the server machine.
    When prompted for a hostname or IP address, use the IP address for the windows instance that AWS gives to you.
    Make sure you log in using the Administrator user and the password given to you.
  You should now be able to access the windows instance
